# Neural Network Multi Classification Project with PyTorch

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive PyTorch project designed to tackle a Multiclassification problem using a neural network. It provides a step-by-step implementation covering the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data generation and preprocessing to model training, handling imbalanced data, evaluation, and advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and model interpretation.

The project is structured to be both an executable example and a detailed educational resource, explaining the "why" and "how" behind each phase of building a robust neural network multiclassification model.
